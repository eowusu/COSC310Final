what, define,~ Overloading is when two or more methods have the same name but different signature (different argument types, different number of arguments).,~

The interaction of overloading and overriding, in Java makes the story a little more complicated. Overloading resolves statically to a particular method signature. Then at runtime, dynamic dispatch will select the most appropriate method with that signature.,~
